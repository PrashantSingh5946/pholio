      `I've been developing full-stack applications ever since i learnt PHP and MySql.(Yes that was the first language i learnt even before JavaScript and CSS)`,
      `After learning javaScript and CSS there was just no stopping, my first project was an email service that provided anonymity (Until it had to be taken down for Obvious reasons)`,
      `I stepped right after high school into an MNC as a software engineer, after that there was just no looking back, I now have React,Node Js, TypeScript, C#, Python, MongoDB and Express in my arsenal.`,
      `I have also spent quite some time in API and UI automation using Postman,Cypress, Testcafe and Selenium (I know it is ancient).`
